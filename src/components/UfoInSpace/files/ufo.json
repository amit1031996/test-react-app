    "text": "Golden orb follows car, then changes into black triangle ufo, stops , and \"waits\" for them to pass close by. \n \nIt was New Years day, 1998. Approximately 10:55 pm in Wisconsin, USA. \n \n Three people were driving from Milwaukee to West Allis on a routine 20 minute drive to drop off a companion on a cold New Year's night. While on the apex of a bridge adjacent to an industrial area, the back passenger spotted a golden light, flashing at a rate of about 4 flashes per second, moderately high in the dark southwestern sky [see FIGURE 1]. It was about the size and color of a small, golden street light, fixed in the sky behind and to the left of the vehicle. The back-seat passenger alerted the driver and the front passenger to the peculiarity of the light, and they all thought it might be some sort of \"helicopter\" or \"star\". As there was hardly any traffic, the driver slowed the vehicle down between 10 to 15 mph. \n \n The object conspicuously glided down towards the ground and closer to the observers. It ceased flashing and became a solid \"gold-light orb\" [see FIGURE 2]. Now seeming to be only a few blocks away to their left (west), it began to parallel the movement of the vehicle—keeping up with its exact speed.. It was fairly low to the ground because it was somewhat being obscured by some thin tree branches (without leaves) along the roadside. \n \n The vehicle, now having passed off the bridge, continued to move northbound towards a major intersection. As the driver slowed even more to get into the left-hand turn lane at a stop light, a red light rotated around the left side of the object, and then a blue light rotated around to the right side of the object. Both lights stopped at the visible edges and remained fixed at the object's respective sides for only a moment—disappearing within seconds [see FIGURE 3]. At this point the object was moving at its slowest. Because of the sudden appearance of the “police” lights and its speed, the witnesses concluded that it must be a police helicopter on a mission. \n \n As the car sat at a complete stop in the left-hand turn lane, there were a few cars to the right of the vehicle. But people in those cars were not looking toward the object, which was traveling at a laborious pace very low to the ground (perhaps a 100 ft). It could barely be seen unless you were looking for it. As the object began to cross over the avenue they were going to turn onto (west), it now appeared to “branch out” into a string of five pale-white lights. It moved silently, almost at “walking speed”. The witnesses rationalized that it might be some sort of plane trying to make an emergency landing - but why land perpendicular to the street?  The lights suddenly stopped and became fixated directly above an estimated seven story factory building just two blocks away. The traffic light changed to green, and the driver finally turned left toward the object; it was just up ahead. No other cars or people were out on this usually busy street. Curiosity and perplexity filled the witnesses as they moved closer to the building. \n \n Finally, the car pulled over to the side of the road. The back passenger rolled down his window and stuck his head out of the car to observe what could be resting in the sky above. The other two people strained to get a good view from the front passenger window. What seemed like a string of lights from a few blocks away on approach were actually the lights on the \"front\" and underneath of a large, black, equilateral triangle object. The five lights shown down like \"baseball stadium lights\", and were located at all three corners and in the middle of the two \"front\" sides [see FIGURE 4]. \n \n This large object was “fixed” in the air, producing absolutely no noise, movement, or flashing. Everything around them seemed so still, almost like they were in a vacuum and “weren’t supposed to be there.” The body of the triangle was colored charcoal-black, with a faint, grayish grove running along the front tip to the back center. There were visible sides: the edges showing a continuous grayish-black indentation with a slight overhang or lip. There also seemed to be very faint “circuit board” type etches on the body of the object. These apparent etchings were more apparent in the center grove on the “belly” of the triangle and within the groove or indentation along the sides. One witness later remarked that some of its features reminded him of a “Star Destroyer” space vehicle from the Star Wars movies. \n \n After approximately 30 seconds of viewing the object, the driver became agitated and fearful, saying that they “have to get out of here.” He drove away and continued westbound on the avenue. When they left, the object left their point of view. But as they increased their distance at a block away, it came into view again in the back window, still fixated in the sky in the exact position last seen. Anyone else viewing the object might have passed and though nothing of it. It was so still and innocuous, that they probably would have thought it was part on the building complex. As the car passed over a hill a few blocks west of the object, it could not be seen any more. No other cars were observed on the road until about a half mile later. \n \n The total experience was less than 5 minutes. \n \n The three witnesses remained shaken for the rest of the night, with one of them insisting that it must be some sort of police helicopter performing a maneuver, and never wanting to talk about it again. \n \n The most disturbing thing to the witness in the back seat was that even though he had been a big “UFO buff” from the time he was young, the word “UFO” or “alien” never entered his mind until after the triangle was completely out of view. He even had other UFO related experiences before this, but still cannot explain why he wasn’t “freaking out” at the time. The best explanation was that “he was denying it in his mind to keep his body from freaking out.”  The strangest element to the whole experience was the apparent personal awareness the object had to the witnesses. It got their attention by flashing, moved in and followed alongside the vehicle at a distance, changed forms, and seemed to wait for them and them only. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Date of sighting may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.

The craft seemed to appear out of nowhere and hovered over the neighborhood for a few minutes. We were on the third story and the craft wasnt much higher than us, though it was about 100 or so yards away. We estimate that the craft itself was about 50 yards across. It was disc shaped and had multiple multi-colored lights that were constantly blinking around the entire ship. When asked to describe it, I always state that it had a great resemblence to the ship from the movie \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". However, I had not seen this film prior to my sighting, so I do not think that had any effect on my recollection. \n \nIt hovered briefly over the neighborhood and began to glide further and further away. We saw it slowly float behind some trees then it suddenly gained a great amount of speed and disappeared. The following morning, several people around the neighborhood mentioned the encounter as well. \n \nTil this day, my mother, cousin, and I still stand by our recollection of the event.",

It was a moonless sky before sunrise.  At least I do not remember seeing the moon. I saw three white or yellowish white lights moving slowly from the west to the east in a triangular formation at an undeterminable altitude and velocity.  I assumed that these lights were all part of one object because they did not move in relation to each other (their triangular pattern remained stable).  There was no red flashing red light that is typically seen with aircraft at night nor was there a sound of a jet or propeller engine nor was there the chopping sound of the rotary blades of a helicopter.  There was no apparent sound at all.  The light formation was close enough so that if I extended my hand that the two outer lights could just be seen on either side of my index finger.  The lack of red flashing lights is what captured my attention and inclined me to get a better look.  I was indoors when I first saw it but I went out doors within less than a minute of first seeing it and watched it move east disappearing into the eastern sky.  When I got out doors it was still close enough to still clearly make out three lights.  Several minuets later as the sun was coming up I saw an airplane moving in exactly the opposite direction with the typical red flashing light and propeller engine sound. \n \nI assume it could be some type of military air craft.",

At first, we thought it was a large aircraft with it's landing lights on, heading westbound toward Tulsa International Airport. As we continued to observe the light, we noticed that it did not move. We were able to get out of our car and watch the light for an hour, and it never changed position in relation to us, the horizon, or any other observable object, while the stars progressed across the sky as normal. \n \n The object is obviously geosynchronus as it has been in the same position in the sky visible at the same basic time every morning for three months. The only time it is otherwise visible is on Monday nights, when it is visible all night long. It is not visible any other night of the week until approx. 04:30am. \n \n I have written NASA asking what this might be, but have received no response from them. At leasat ten other people have observed this same phenomenon, almost all are law enforcement officers as I. i believe it may simply be a satellite, but it's position does not match anything I have been able to find on sites such as NASA's downloadable satellite tracking software. \n \n Not saying it's a spaceship or anything, but no one seems to be willing to tell me what it is. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note: Probable sighting of celestial body.

I became stunt for few seconds then i turned about and grab my cousin's arm who was standing directly infront of me and told him to look at that direction and then i found the thing disappeared. \n \n i never got to tell anyone because i thought no one here would believe me. i live in brunei and this place is a small country so maybe there's lesser chance for me to meet someone who have seen similar things. i was surprise to find this website where i can share with everyone who probably would have the encounter the same thing. \n \n Even today i never got to tell much people here because im worried they will think im NUTs :0  from my memory, i remember that the object was not the typical saucer look which we always get on TV/indepandent day/internet/discovery channel. \n \nIt was something different. it was very high-tech and unique. it is nothing like what i've ever seen in any movies. There were many details on the body of the craft as if it looks like pipes / wiring attached to the body. from the distance where i was standing, i consider the object small. probably measuring about 4 to 5 feet lenght x  4 feet width x 3 to 5 feet thickness. no lights were seen. i can see that object with available lights because i was close enough from that subject as the house had some lightings around the surrounding of the garden to lite up some part of the roof. \n \n The stangest thing i canot figure out how it can do was; the object was actually floating on top of the roof (probably less then a feet away from the roof), the roof were soft and old and it should have made noise. even rain drops falling onto the roof would make noise but from my distant i hear nothing from the object and the roof (the corner part) was not even rattling. \n \n after that incident i've always wish to see it another time. \n \ni told some of my friends i wish to see them again. i consider myself very lucky to see it that close because from documentary, discovery channels, books, internet sites, videos...all those who said they have seen are from a very great distant and they can't really judge how it look like. most of them say its like a saucer. but for me, it can look like anything. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

They appeard to be perfectly still in the night sky.  I tried to focus on them as best I could while at the same time looking forward to watch the road.  \n \nThe formation itself seemed to be 2-3 miles wide and the mass was fairly low to the ground.  \n \n After about 10 minutes they blinked out all at once, as if they vanished into thin air.  \n \nWhen I got home i tried to analyze what I had saw.

Then another light appeared out of no where and joined the other object, circling it a few times then disappeared behind another range. It looked as if they were 'playing'- we watched for a good 15 minutes as they would move straight up and down and then sideways, at one point I thought I spotted a third but it was so difficult to tell because it appeared so dim- They would pulsate, these objects would get very bright and change almost like a rainbow of warmer colors red yellows etc. They did get very dim and disappear and then reappear very bright or fade back into view, very strange, yet very exciting- I would have sat there forever but the boys in the backseat were so scared they were getting sick to ther stomachs-Sounds silly but I though well If I can see them this clear they must be able to see my headlights, so I jokingly flashed my head lights on and off a few times  but what happened then really freaked us all out- both objects shot out in a perfect line up as if someone screamed at them to stop- I started to drive and the objects slowly followed us around the ridgline for about 20 seconds then one stayed with us for apprx 2 minutes as if Peeking at us from behind the mountain-  I am still bothered that I could not sit there forever and watch- We tried to capture them on video but it was sso dark It justwould not focus so far away :-(( I want to go back I want to see more I guess! I reall y want to know what the hell I was watching  out there- We have seen a lot of the same type things in the skies in this  same general area, but never this close or vivid in the past 4 years - we go camping and hiking almost every weekend rain or shine.",

    "text": "Massive silent black triangle over Kosovo \n \nI am an ex British army soldier and have been interested in this phenomenon of \"black triangles\" since encountering one whilst on tour in Kosovo in 2004. I'd just like to share my version in a hope it helps shed some light. On the night it happened I was outside our temporary accommodation at a site we were sharing with the Russian army. I was sitting at a table on a patio area we had knocked up watching a DVD on a portable player. \n \nThe night was very clear and warm. Most of the other lads were either at the gym or the bar. Shortly before the event I was joined by a mate (I don't remember who unfortunately) who sat down to watch the DVD. \n \nAt some point I leaned back on my chair and stretched my arms out behind me facing straight up at the sky. When I did so the first thing I remember seeing was a big patch of \"starless\" sky. This freaked me out straight away but within the next second it became apparent that the patch was triangular in shape because it was moving. This made me realise that it was not the stars that were missing but something massive, black and silent moving in front of them as at the front of the point of the triangle the stars were disappearing while at the back they were re-appearing. \n \nIt was hard to judge whether the object was small and close or large and far away because of the lack of sound. My initial reaction and with hindsight I would say that it was a massive object simply because of the amount of stars it was blanking out as it moved across the sky and also the speed which it travelled. If it was a small object it was moving FAR too slowly to stay airborne surely. If I had to estimate, i would say that this thing was at least 500 meters and most likely a kilometer wide at an altitude of around 5-8000 ft. \n \nAs it passed silently over the mountain horizon I turned to my mate who was also looking up and asked \"did you see that?\" he replied \"yes, what was it?\". He had followed my gaze at the sky and witnessed the same thing. \n \nThe next day I casually asked my commanding officer if there were any stealth aircraft being flown in the area and he said he didn't think so. I'd seen stealth bombers and fighters before and I know it definitely was not one of those I saw. It had no navigation lights for one thing. \n \nI have only just got round to looking into this and just recently googled \"black triangle ufo\" and was amazed at the amount of reports I found. Although it would be awesome to know it was of alien origin, it seems to me (from what I have read) that it could well be a very secret military transport \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

    "text": "Twin-disc 'pivoting' UFO observed to rapidly cross the skies of Slough, U.K., in 1977/ 1978. \n \nI regret that the incident happened so long ago that I am unable to give a precise date. My experience happened in 1977 or 1978, when I was 15 or 16 years old. I was the only witness. At the time, I was a member of my local astronomical society, with responsibility for co-ordinating meteor observation. Astronomy was a serious hobby for me then, and I was used to observing the skies and being able to identify the normal kind of objects in the heavens, e.g. stars, meteors, planets, satellites, and planes. It was late, possibly past midnight – I often did meteor watches through the early hours. I was doing a meteor watch, alone, and lying on a camp bed out on the balcony in front of my house in Slough, Berkshire, UK. \n \n Suddenly there was an astonishing phenomenon in the sky of a kind I had never seen before, and have never seen since. It was definitely not an astronomical phenomenon or any description of human vehicle I know of. The object(s) crossed my field of vision rapidly, within a second or maybe even half a second, so it was moving at incredibly high speed. It consisted of two discs of light. They moved so rapidly that it was difficult to distinguish whether they were clearly defined discs or whether the edges were diffuse, but my memory recalls my perception as being that they were fairly diffuse. Although the discs were about a third or half the diameter of the moon, they were not particularly bright – certainly not as bright as the moon – but not particularly dull, either. The strange thing about them is that they seemed to be connected in some way, as the two discs seemed to be rocking or pivoting about a central axis as they rapidly crossed the skies, so that the discs would during this rocking process be alternately one further in front than the other. The angle of the rocking from the perpendicular was possibly between 30 and 45 degrees, and during the transit, the discs probably repeated this backwards and forwards rocking motion twice. They were separated by a distance of perhaps four or five times the diameter of the moon. The lights were white, and I saw no colour in them. They left no trail, and the trajectory was practically overhead, and they crossed the whole of my field of vision, until it was obscured by the houses on my left-hand side: I was lying on the camp bed facing perpendicularly into the skies. It was a clear, cloudless night. There was no accompanying sound. I did not perceive anything in the object other than these lights, and at the time assumed that these were two separate objects that happened to be flying together in a formation, but was puzzled as to why they seemed to be rocking backwards and forwards about a common axis. However, in more recent years I have wondered whether they! were bo th fixed to the base of a larger, dark craft, whose base was undergoing this rocking motion for some reason: although I was not able to distinguish any craft to which the lights were joined, because of its speed, and the state of utter shock and anxiety I was in when I saw the phenomenon, it could just be the case that I did not notice it. \n \n I shared this information with my parents, and I wrote a report containing much of the detail above, though I cannot remember after all this time what I did with the report: whether I lodged it anywhere - which I think is unlikely, as the Internet wasn’t yet available then, and I wouldn’t have known where to send it – or more likely, whether I filed it somewhere at home and have lost it in the course of the years. \n \n At the time of witnessing this event, I was very much a sceptic with regard to the question of UFOs: I knew enough about relativity to believe that other stars were too far away for extraterrestrial visits to be possible, given the velocity limit of the speed of light. I was simply forced to abandon my scepticism by what I saw with my own eyes. As mentioned above, I was also used to astronomical observations, and could easily have identified a very unusual but natural object, such as a fireball, or a satellite re-entering the atmosphere. \n \n I have scoured the Internet to find out whether anyone has seen anything at all similar to my rocking twin-disc UFO, but have been unsuccessful. I would be extremely interested to know whether you have ever received a report describing anything similar. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))",

    "text": "Strange lights above the highway on a stormy night. \n \nWhile driving w/b on Highway 160 out of Las Vegas I saw 2 lights ahead which I thought may have been landing lights on an aircraft.  It was very windy and the sky was completely overcast with low clouds.  As I drove nearer it was apparent the lights, which looked like white globes, were either stationary or moving very slowly above the highway, and they appeared to move apart as I closed with them.  As I passed beneath them, 6 very dim white lights became visible; four in a diamond shape between the globes (closer to the right globe than the left) and then two placed equally distant trailing west.  Unlike the two bright lights, the light from the smaller six looked indirectly lit, like distant windows appear in the nighttime.  The lights were then blocked from view as we passed beneath them.  My wife was with me but was not in the least interested and paid no attention to either me or the lights. Also, on the drive back to Tecopa I was astonished to find my night vision was restored--the halos I'd become used to seeing around oncoming headlights were gone and I could actually see the road ahead as headlights passed. It only lasted a week or so, but man was that a great thing.  I don't know for sure that it was associated with whatever it was I saw in the sky, but I do know that my vision immediately after I saw the lights was a whole lot better than before. \n \nI can submit a sketch of the lights' configuration on request, IF I can figure out how to load it into this computer.",

    "text": "Three unidentified orange objects over Cardiff, New Years Day 2009 \n \nThese were extremely strange lights that were sighted by myself and my wife just after Midnight on New Years Day, 2009. (Yes, there were fireworks going off and no, these were not fireworks!) As a bit of background, I've been a Police Officer for 17 years, all of these being on operational duties.  I served in the Royal Air Force for six years and I have a life long interest in aircraft, thanks to my father.  I would say that I am very knowledgeable about aircraft types.  I am always looking up at aircraft so I am used to seeing things in the air. \n \nJust before Midnight on 31st December 2008, my wife and I went into our loft room in order to watch the fireworks going off over Cardiff.  The velux windows in the loft face north and we had a view of 180 degrees from west to east.  The weather was dry with a slight haze.  Even with the haze, visibility was good. \n \nAt about 00.05 hours, I saw an orange coloured ball of light over the west of Cardiff.  I would estimate that it was about 3 miles away from my position and at a height of about 5000ft.  There were no strobe lights on this object and it moved at a steady pace from south to north, in a straight, horizontal line.  It was in sight for about 10 seconds before disappearing, and it did just vanish from sight as there were no objects between it and me to obscure it from view.  When I first saw it, I pointed it out to my wife who watched it as well. \n \nWithin about 5 seconds of the first object disappearing, I saw another one, this time directly in front of my position so it was over the north of Cardiff, at about the same height but I would estimate at a distance of 2 miles.  It was exactly the same colour as the first and moved from east to west, again in a straight, horizontal line, remaining at the same height.  It remained in view for about 10 seconds and then just disappeared, like the first one. \n \nWithin 10 seconds, I saw yet another object, exactly the same as the first two and exactly the same colour.  This one was above my position and was moving from east to west.  It was bigger than the first two and I believe that it appeared so because it was at a lower height.  Again, it moved in a straight line and was visible for about 5 seconds before vanishing.  Also again, there was nothing that could have obscured my view of it such as a building it could have flown behind etc. \n \nAt this point, my wife decided that she had seen enough and went downstairs and, unfortunately, I had to go with her.  The sight of the lights had spooked her. \n \nI have mentioned these lights to colleagues and one of them put forward the Chinese lantern theory but the lights just appeared, travelled in a straight, horizontal line and then disappeared.  They were in three completely different places and they did not have the flight characteristics of a floating lantern. \n \nThese things weren't travelling at a high speed.  I would say the speed was about that of a helicopter.  In fact, when I saw the first light, I thought that it was the Police helicopter but the colour of the light and the widespread locations as well as the complete lack of any strobe or other flashing lights on the objects soon dispelled that idea. \n \nI have no explanation regarding the identity of these lights.",

    "text": "Multiple Orange & Red Spheres Over Southern Mexico \n \nI was celebrating New Year's Eve with a number of other people in a restaurant near my home.  We all saw a bright orange light moving roughly from west to east, and we stopped all of our festivities (musicians included) to watch.  The fireworks for the evening had ended several minutes before. The sighting took about 4-5 minutes before the sphere was out of sight.  It flew (floated) directly over the restaurant. I estimate its height to be no more than 4,000 feet above the ground. The object appeared small, maybe a few meters across, and, just like last year's sighting, emanated a fuzzy orange color that looked a lot like a plasma.  There was no sound, and several other attendees said they had also seen the same kind of event last year. \n \nFrom there, I walked back to my home, and continued to look for more orange lights.  I wasn't disappointed.  I sat on my rooftop, and after about 5 minutes, another orange sphere came from the north and traveled almost exactly south, until it was out of sight.  It floated quite a distance away over the ocean.  So from where I live, I was looking directly west.  There was no sound. About two minutes later a third orange sphere, this time maybe 300 yards closer to my home, floated by, north to south. Again, no sound.  These orange spheres were then followed by two red spheres, each about two to three minutes apart, and each one slightly closer to my home, by what appeared to be equal distances.  It looked as though they were all following a specific north to south direction in a grid pattern, all of the objects acting together. \n \nIf I take all of the spheres as one complete sighting, then the sighting lasted a total of about 30-35 minutes.",

    "text": "slowly moving and rotating UFO at night \n \nI am sorry to come to the point to report the event so much time after it happened... \n \nI live in a village (approx. 2000 residents) 25 km from Budapest.  It was a winter evening (2008 or 2009) around 6 to 7 pm (fully dark). It was overcast with cloud base at approx 100 m (300 ft). \n \nI drove home from work, parked my car in the garage and went up the (outside) stairs to enter my house.  After a few steps on the stairs I could see over the garage and noticed a strange thing. \n \nDim blueish green light sources on a circular pattern, about 10 pcs, rotating slowly around the center, about half rotation per sec.  It seemed as they were on the bottom of a circular object, which is spinning horizontally.  I could not see the object itself, so unsure about its shape, because there was not any backlight.  I could just see the lights on its bottom.  It was about 300 m away from me and with the little reference to other objects (some tall trees) I estimate its diameter to be 15 m, and its altitude 50 m over the land.  There is a main railway line at the edge of the village and it seemed a bit farther than that, over the lands. \n \nIt was hovering, no movement and the rotation was also stable.  The lights were also stable in color and brightness.  First I thought someone was playing with kind of a disco laser light, which would probably project similarly on a very smooth cloud base.  But after about 5 seconds it started to move left (East) in a way what was very surprising to me and excluded the disco light possibility.  \n \nFirst it tipped left about 20 to 30 deg and started to move in that direction.  Then it tipped right the same amount, and continued this slow left-right tipping, while moving slowly to East (50 kmh?), and out of my sight (other buildings, trees and terrain blocking sight). \n \nI told my wife what I just saw and to my workmates next day.   \n \nI am an electrical engineer and have a PPL and tried to identify the object based on my knowledge, but I still cannot explain it. \n \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

The sky was completely overcast so it was clear the the object was not a star or anything in space. We were watching some fireworks in the distance so many of our eyes were turned skyward.  I don't have any directions to give you at all but the light in the sky was there for about 10 minutes before it registered with me.  I just thought that it was a super bright star but then after the fireworks stopped it hit me that the sky was completely clouded over and at that time I called it to the attention of my five friends.  Nobody had any idea of what it could be and after about 10 more minutes the object started to slowly move over the city.  Two of us had cameras but my friend with the digital camera had (wouldn't you believe it, just at this moment, just like in the movies!) technical problems and he was not able to get a shot. I was able to get off a few shots.  I made sure that I got a building in the picture to aid in determining the distance and with luck a low flying airplane flew near the object so I was able to get the object, an airplane, and a building in one shot.  The camera was just a little point and shoot model so the negatives are extremely underexposed.  I don't know how much use they would be. It really just looks like a light with a dark background. The object moved out of my view after about twenty minutes.  We heard no sounds coming from the object. I was wondering if anybody else reported this.  It must have been seen by a lot of people because it was up there for so long and it was moving so slow. I would love to hear something from you. I can get images to you if you would like them.

We had the radio tuned to 94 fm: the edge. We were headed into New Plymouth at the time and i knew there was enough coverage in the area to keep the radio waves going. The radio started giving a static buzz at about the time we left inglewood.This continued for about 1 minute and we decided to switch the radio off. As we approached the next corner I saw an orange light over the trees. It soon vanished. As we neared the sighting spot we slowed down to see what it may have been. Nothing unusual could be seen. We retained speed through the next few corners and something orange hovered above us. It appeared to be about 100 feet from the ground and looked to be between 30 and 50 feet long and the same in width (basically circular). There were five of us in the car at the time:Me, my brother, his girlfriend, their friend and a friend of my own. We all could see it. The object seemed to hover soundlessly as we all stepped out of the car. As we looked around we saw three other objects hovering and swaying around in the air. They looked like they were changing colour from metallic glowing orange to metallic deep purple and shades of blue. One more larger object appeared on the horizon and sped towards the other 4. Each seemed to react in a way similiar to an army unit and formed a line and dissapeared almost instantly over towards Mount Taranaki. As we left several minutes later we realized we hadn't seen any traffic for about half an hour and only saw some as we entered new plymouth. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Report submitted by student.  PD))",

    "text": "Visitation Experience in Korea and other events \n \nI can't recall the year, but it was between 1978-1980.  I was in the U.S. Air Force, stationed at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.  I was living off base inside a housing compound, outside the local town called Silvertown.  There was no light in the one roomed apartment, yet when I looked, I could see clearly.  I remember waking up on the floor.  My wife was on the bed to my left and slightly behind me.  My attention was drawn to the direction of the doorway.  I saw a large dark figure standing in the door.  The figure seemed to be wearing a hooded cloak or cape.  I think it was dark grey or black  in color. \n \nI sat there just staring at it when it seemed to start approaching me.  It didn't appear to be walking.  It seemed to glide across the floor.  I tried to back away from it but couldn't move.  I tried to call for my wife but couldn't make any sound. \n \nAlthough my body refused to respond to my efforts to move, I can remember thinking that if I could make a sound, the fear, and the figure, would go away.  While I can remember it moving toward me, I don't remember it traveling the distance of the room to where I was laying.  That is to say, I only remember it moving a distance of about 3 or 4 feet. I can't recall it ever actually reaching me.  My struggle to move or make some kind of sound seemed to go on for several minutes.  My heart was pounding in my chest and I was desperately trying to call for my wife. \n \nSuddenly, I managed to make a whisper/squeak of a noise.  I tried again and the noise came easier this time. Finally, I was calling my wife's name.  I could move as well, although it was extremely difficult.  I dragged myself to our bed.  I reached up and as I was about to touch my wife, everything was back to normal, if you can call it that.  The stranger was gone. So was the loss of my voice and my inability to move.  However, the room was darker and it was harder to see.  I was still on the floor and my wife was sleeping soundly on the bed.  My heart began to slow down and the pounding reduced itself to a normal beating. \n \nI just sat there. To this day, I call still recall parts of this incident with great clarity.  But I'm not sure if it was a dream.  I don't recall if I had been drinking alcohol that night but it is a very real possibility.  Nor do I understand why I was on the floor instead of the bed with my wife. \n \nI don't know if my wife recalls any of this. I don't even remember if I ever talked to my wife about this, but through the years, I've told this story to others when the topic of strange things comes up. \n \nAt the risk of coming off as a nut case, other strange things have happened to me as well and are as clear or vivid but may mean nothing. \n \nWhile stationed at RAF Lakenheath in the United Kingdom between 1982-83, I recalled leaving the shop one night to go across the street to another building.  As I left the shop, I was in a direct line of sight to the door that I was heading for.  Suddenly, I ran into a heating fuel containment wall some 8 to 10 feet off the original path I was on.  I don't know how I got my original course but it did leave scratches on my shins. \n \nAnother incident at the same base and time frame occurred when I left the shop to catch the bus home.  I left the shop at 10 minutes till 1 AM for what should have been a one minute walk to the bus stop.  However, after I arrived at the stop, I checked my watch and it said the time was 20 minutes after 1AM.  In these two incidents, no alcohol was involved due to the fact that I was just coming off duty. \n \nAnd one morning while in England during the 82-83 time frame, I awoke to find myself inside my wardrode (closet).  However, this one could have been due to drinking, but I thought I'd mention it. \n \nWhile station at Hurlburt Field, Florida between 1991-92, I used to drive a stretch of road every night that was not well traveled or lit at that time of night.  On numerous occasions while driving, I expected to hear a loud popping noise come from the dash of my car.  The expectation was so strong that my eyes where prepared to close the way they do when someone is hammering on something over and over and then they suddenly stop, but your eyes still twitch in anticipation of the next blow. \n \nOne night late 1996 or early 97, while at work with the Gate Rubber Co in Siloam Springs, Arkansas, I experienced what you would call lost time.  I worked with six presses that cure belts for the company.  On this night, I was waiting for press number 4 to open.  I decided to go check something on press number 1 about 15-20 feet away.  I looked at the timer on press 4 and saw that I had 1 minute and 45 seconds before the press was ready to open, so I turned around to go to press 1.  As soon as I turned around and started to take a step, press number 4 opened up.  I stopped and turned back around.  I wondered if maybe I had looked at the wrong timer, but none of the other timers on the unit were set anywhere near a minute and 45.  It was only a minute and 45 seconds and I didn't feel anything else was out of order, but I still recall it with great clarity. \n \nOne day after I had begun working for the University of Arkansas, I experience an incident where I seemed to gain time.  I checked the time that I entered Hwy 412 at the intersection of hwy 530 (old Hwy 71). And began the 20 minute drive to Siloam.  As I entered the City limits, I checked the time again and found that I had made the trip in 10 minutes.  I verified the operation of my watch and the Curise Control that I always used and found them to be in good working order.  I’ve never heard of anyone gaining time, although I have experienced times that I felt time had past quicker than I thought it should have. \n \nI have the standard \"Scoop\" mark on my left leg that I’ve heard and read about.  It's been there as long as I can remember. And in 1999, I noticed that there was a scoop mark on the top of my left hand.  I don’t recall anything out of the ordinary having happened at the time. \n \n*********** Additional back ground information. \n \nWhile I was in the sixth grade, I experienced several incident where there were large scabs in my nostrials.  I remember that my grandmother used to have to use large hair pins to remove them.  This lasted several weeks. \n \nAround 1976/77 while stationed at Beale AFB in California and living in the barracks, I got up one night to go to the bathroom.  As I walked past my papasan chair, I saw someone sitting there and stepped around them to go into the hall.  I closed the door behind me.  When I went back to my room, I had locked myself out. I knocked on the door, but no one answered.  I finally had to go outside and break into the room.  No one was there and the next day, when I asked my friends if any of them had been in the room, they all said no. \n \nAfter reading all this, I wouldn't blame anyone for thinking that I was a nutcase looking for attention.  But I swear that it’s all true to the best of my knowledge.  It’s also convinced me that I need to keep a document of dates, times, and conditions, should anything else occur.  Thanks for taking the time to read through this and as always, if you have any quesitons, please let me know.",

    "text": "ufo's travel in formation of orion for three hours disguising themselves as stars \n \nHi there, Im writing to thise site because I would like the rest of the people out there to what i saw, and if it has a meaning. I would also like answeres as to what is really going on out there.I would be grateful and appreciate it if my story was entered into your reports. \n \nMayby there other people have also had simmiler experiences.Latley I have been seeing objects in the skys that are not supposed to be there. This happens often,especially in the late hours till the next morning.Id like to share one of my experiances with people who will take me seriously.One night about12:30pm , I went out into my garden because i couldn't sleep. I was sitting with my dogs when i saw movement in the sky i also felt there was another presance somewhere,I looked up. I saw coming from the east of the sky object moving slowly heading towards the southern part of the sky then going west.Firstly I thought them to be stars or satellights but then stars dont move left right up or down or change shape from big to small ,neither do satellights change colour or flicker.They were moving slowly about eight of them. When they reached the west direction in the sky they became totally still.Im not sure if they were in our skys or i saw them from space near earth i dont know how far unless they were very high up in the sky They were travelling in the formation of the star sign orion when they stoped some of the objects began expanding in shape and colour brightness and started zigzaging in there position in the sky Except for four which remained still and decreased in terms of size to a small stars.These four were in the formation of the belt of orion. Thats the three . The one object in the middle of the belt started to expand and emited a very bright light and then pulsated.After that they all broke up there formation of orion and seperated into different directions then dissapeared Id like to know what does their behaviour mean, and what is the significance of orion and why they made that formation giving special awarness to the belt if orion.I would like to know what star is in the middle of orions belt and the little one next to the belt.Is there a meaning to that part of the galaxy where orion is situated.Please inform me about these questions i have asked and also as to what is happening in the skys.I would appreciate it also if any one has seen the same thing or somthing simlir please email me at ((e-address deleted))",

    "text": "Near end of 1AM fireworks while standing outside Metro station in DC observed at least 5 cylindrical things moving at high speed across sky \n \nI attended \"America's Millennium\" celebration on the national mall in Washington DC New Year's Eve.  Up until 1:00 AM the weirdest thing I saw was a dumb guy climbing dangerously on a large tree.  I had no expectation of a UFO sighting then nor at anytime.  After the 12:00 fireworks and some music and laser lights (which were disappointing), I decided we (me and my friend) should start leaving, as the crowd was incredibly huge.  We walked through part of downtown DC including the George Washington University to the Foggy Bottom Metro Station.  As we got near the station the crowd swelled again as people try to get to the few escalators going down.  It took a very long time to get to the escalator, so I stood and listened and people-watched.  At about 1:00 AM there was the sound of explosions and it made me \"jump\".  It was just the 2nd round of fireworks being launched from a barge in the Potomac River behind the Lincoln Memorial.  Thank God it wasn't real bombs.  All we could see were the flashes of light behind 12-story buildings and some reflections in office windows.  The fireworks lasted about 6 minutes, and after about 2-3 minutes of fireworks as I was inching my way along in the crowd, I noticed near the western horizon what appeared to be (a) shooting star(s).  I was not looking directly at it though.  I said to my friend, \"What good timing for shooting stars!  It's great to see that during the fireworks.\"  Then I saw more, and this time I got a better look at what they were.  (It also occurred to me later that the \"shooting star(s)\" never \"burned up in the atmosphere.\")  I saw a pair of dark but lit cylindrical objects \"flying\" in formation from NW to SE passing almost directly above me.  Definitely not meteors.  They looked identical.  They moved at high speed, but I was able to see them well enough while they lasted, since I was now looking for more \"shooting stars\".  Less than a minute later a single cylinder moved from WSW to ENE at about the same speed and had the same appearance.  I then ! said, to no one in particular and not loudly really, \"Am I seeing UFOs?\"  My friend was either caught up in the fireworks and/or crowd and didn't notice anything.  No one said anything after my last comment, but then very few people around me would have been able to hear me with so many people jabbering and the incredibly loud, echoing fireworks.  At this point I was almost at the beginning of the escalator.  I guess \"resistance is futile\"; I felt I had no choice but to get on the thing.  If I could do it over again, I would have grabbed my friend and tried to get out of the way so I could hang around and look for more of these things, whatever they were.  I have searched the Washington Post's of the last few days but have not been able to find anything on any UFO sightings.  I am now searching the internet for the same (for the first time) and happened upon this site.  I hope this helps me resolve what it was I saw.  I am keeping a wide-open mind and not jumping to conclusions.  Anyone else?  Please speak up if you saw them.  Thanks!",

    "text": "This incident took place in 1967 or 1968 while I was stationed in Okinawa in the Air Force. I was assigned to maintain and operate a small 24 hour diesel power house at this very powerfull search radar site called Yoza Dake Air Station. We were loacted at the southern tip of the island and there was a Army Hawk missle site near us. One night me and a co-worker were coming out of a NCO club that was our late night mess hall as the regular mess hall closed at 7 pm. We had a Okinawan waitress that came out side with us as she was beginning to clean up the NCO club and she was coming out to get a mop bucket and a mop as she did almost every night. When we came out of the door she shouted out in Japanese ..OH My God. (OK Sami Yo).. and she ran back inside the NCO cluub. We were very astonished ourselves in the very large red/orange colored light that appeared at 25 -30 degrees above the horizon on the eastern side of the mountain top. We asked each other what could this light be from as it was not usual to see any light on the east side of the mountain as the Naha Airbase has a glide path on the west side of the island and our radar site. We asked each other who had a camera in the barracks which was only about 50 meters away. My friend ran to get his 35 mm camera and I stayed and observed this light alone for about 5 or 10 minutes. The weather was pretty humid and there was a slight misty rain earlier, but it was not raining when we saw this huge bright light. While I was waiting for him to come out of the barracks I was walking towards the rear door of the barracks and watching this light which is very bright. The intensity of the light seemed to stay steady. and it did not move at all and then it suddenly disappeared befor my co-worker came out of the door with his camera. We asked our radar observers that was on duty that night in the block house if they saw any boogies on the radar screens that night and they said no. But later after many questions some did admit the radar observers were! tracking this and some other boogies. Later after this incident one of the senior radar observers said they have logged many unknown boogies there over the years in a daily log book. We both talked about this openly with the 80 plus  staff on the radar site and some were open to discussions but most said they could not discuss these boogies as they were instructed by their officers to remain quiet about boogies. A very well known radio personally who was in the Air Force then was also there at this time. He was moonlighting as a DJ at a local NAHA radio station there that we all listened too called KSBK. He is the host of After Dark on the weekends now. I remeber there was newspaper articles in the local dailies as this light or lights were observed in many places that night and it scared alot of people. The KSBK radio station had radio news stories about this light that same night as we went back to barracks and listen to the DJ as the station received alot of call in reports. I visited the KSBK radio station during my 18 month stay there and I was able to meet the current weekend host of After Dark. \n \n((NUFORC Note:  Time and date are approximate.  We have corresponded with the witness, inquiring whether he is still in touch with the other witnesses.  PD))",

We observed these lights for over a span of 10 to 15 minutes, I happened to look up into the night sky and saw more than a couple of stars move, like when you see falling stars, except that these did perfect circular movements and just disappear afterwards.  After witnessing this we noticed that over the horizon of the pacific, quickly a kind of mist or clouds covered these lights and we could no longer see them.  After getting to our destination, as we got out of the car and as I looked up into the night sky, I saw behind the hills a kind of lightning or flash, this was on a clear starry night. \n \n Previously, the day before this, it was around midday.  It was a clear blue sky day, I saw a metallic object cross the sky, it looked like it was far since it was just a small dot, it was round and metallic, the speed of this craft was quite normal and just eased it's way across.  From these sightings I was told that this area in Chile, Constitucion, there are quite alot of sightings and it's very common to see events like this.  Since then I have not gone back, every night I look up and hope to find something interesting.",

I got so engrossed in taking photos of the beautiful Moon using my Nikon P900 camera that I totally forgot I was watching the Moon through a very high optical zoom lens.  Suddenly I saw a HUGE horizontal shadow across the lower part of the Moon; I tried to click the shadow but couldn’t focus and soon realized that the shadow was fast disappearing towards the right side of the Moon. Luckily one click that I took captured a part of the shadow (in the attached photo). \n \nI would request if experts can kindly examine the photo and especially the shadow while it was captured crossing a Moon’s crater the horizontal shadow is clearly appearing crooked on the uneven surface of the crater.",
